Homer’s Iliad is usually thought of as the first work of European literature, and many would say, the greatest.
It tells part of the saga of the city of Troy and the war that took place there.
In fact the Iliad takes its name from “Ilios”, an ancient Greek word for “Troy”, situated in what is Turkey today.
This story had a central place in Greek mythology.
